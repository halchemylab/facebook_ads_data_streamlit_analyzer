## üöß Limitations

This application is a powerful tool for analyzing Facebook Ads data, but it has a few limitations to keep in mind:

- **Data Format Dependency:** The app is specifically designed to parse the standard column structure of Facebook Ads exports. Custom exports with different column names or formats will not work without modifying the source code.
- **API Key Requirement:** The AI-powered features (Recommendations and Q&A) require a valid OpenAI API key. These features will be disabled if a key is not provided.
- **Performance with Large Datasets:** While the application can handle moderately sized datasets, very large files (e.g., millions of rows) may lead to slower performance or high memory usage.
- **No Data Storage:** The application processes data in memory and does not store any of your information. You will need to re-upload your files each time you use the app.
